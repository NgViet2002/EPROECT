    <div class="the-title"><h1>Top 10 most beautiful beaches in the south</h1></div>
    <p>This summer you do not need to go too far to the Maldives or Hawaii, in the south, the countries in this direction also have beautiful paradise islands like dreams that are dubbed "raw gems" due to retaining the pristine beauty of man. Now, let's explore the Top 10 beautiful southbound beaches below to schedule an incredibly enjoyable summer.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/sao.html">1. Sao Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="321" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh1.jpg" alt="10 most beautiful beaches in the west"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Sao Beach is considered to be the most beautiful and famous beach of a large island and Vietnam itself, if not all of Asia. And according to world estimates, the beach is rated quite high. This place is no worse than Long beach, except perhaps less more than twice. And the beauty of the local species is in no way inferior to Ong Lang Beach: the same untouched nature, but more developed infrastructure.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/onglang.html">2. Ong Lang Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh2.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Ong Lang Beach is the exact opposite of the nearest town, Duong Dong, where life is "boiling" literally. Here, the natural element completely captures the whole atmosphere: the sound of waves, rocky terrain, clear water, white sand and wild vegetation. Everything looks as if a person’s hand was not at all attached to this resort. Naturalness, peace and peace are the main terms that characterize Ong Lang Beach.</p>
    <br> 
    
    <h4><a href="gallery/south/long.html">3. Long Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh3.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Long beach is the name that speaks for itself. This is almost 20 kilometers of the cleanest beach area. Belongs to the category of places of rest from a series of "most-most" as it is the longest, most beautiful and most popular. Moreover, such an opinion is formed not only among professional critics from the tourism industry, but also among ordinary tourists who in their reviews really say how it really is. Here you can appreciate not only the territory of the beach, but also the ocean - it is clean, calm and quite warm water surface.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/ganhdau.html">4. Ganh Dau Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh4.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Ganh Dau Beach is a romantic beach located on the northwest coast of Phu Quoc Island, 30 km from the island's capital, Zyong Zong. Gang Dau Beach can be reached by an asphalt road leading east from the fishing village of the same name Gang Dau.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/vungbau.html">5. Vung Bau Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh5.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Vung Bau Beach is one of the last wild beaches of Phu Quoc. It is located in the northwest of the island, washed by the waters of the Gulf of Thailand in the South China Sea. Vung Bau is a beautiful crescent-shaped beach. Water in this part of the island of an unusual sapphire color turns Vung Bau into a paradise.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/baidai.html">6, Bai Dai Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh6.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Bai Dai Beach is little known among tourists. It is located about 20 km from Nha Trang, without reaching Kamran Airport. Earlier, in the 2000s, this territory was reserved for the military bases of Vietnam, and the beach was closed to the public. Bai Dai Beach on Phu Quoc Island is translated from Vietnamese as a long beach. And indeed it is: The length of the beach is about 17 km, it is located in a bay between the neighboring cities, Nha Trang and Kamran.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/baixep.html">7. Bai Xep Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh7.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Bai Xep Beach is located in a small fishing village near the town of Quinen. Distinctive features of the beach are crystal clear water and picturesque views. The beach is surrounded by green hills, and from the sea visible boats and islands in the distance. Unusual round boats with one oar await fishermen on the coastline.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/rachvem.html">8. Rach Vem Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh8.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Rach Vem Beach is one of the most remote and least visited of all the beaches and bays on the island of Phu Quoc, however, Rach Vem Beach is one of the most calm, picturesque and intact parts of the island. The beach is long and narrow, the sea is bright turquoise with calm water and a smooth shallow entrance.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/khem.html">9. Khem Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh9.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Khem Beach, also known as "Bai Kem", "Bai Khem", "Khem Beach" or "Cream Beach" is another of Phu Quoc's white sandy beaches located south of the more popular beach Sao in the city of An Toi. The use of the beach was previously limited to a military base, but since 2014 the restriction has been lifted. According to many sources, Khem beach is one of the most beautiful on the island of Phu Quoc, but it becomes such after 11.00, when the beach is freed by fish and seafood traders: of shrimp, anchovies, sea urchins, etc.</p>
    <br>

    <h4><a href="gallery/south/vong.html">10. Vong Beach, Phu Quoc, Vietnamese</a></h4>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img width="482" height="320" src="../images/imagesouth/hinh10.jpg" alt="10 quốc gia Nam bán cầu mát lành cho mùa hè"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Vong Beach is probably the first beach that many tourists will see. After all, it is here that the majority of boats, ferries with those who wish to relax on the island of Phu Quoc arrive. The economic industry on the coast is constantly evolving, for which new piers are being built, therefore it is obvious that the beach will undergo more and more changes over time.</p>
