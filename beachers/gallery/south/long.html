        <h1>Long beach</h1>
        <p>Long beach is the name that speaks for itself. This is almost 20 kilometers of the cleanest beach area. Belongs to the category of places of rest from a series of "most-most" as it is the longest, most beautiful and most popular. Moreover, such an opinion is formed not only among professional critics from the tourism industry, but also among ordinary tourists who in their reviews really say how it really is. Here you can appreciate not only the territory of the beach, but also the ocean - it is clean, calm and quite warm water surface.</p><br>

    <h1>Beach description</h1>
    <p>The beach is located in the southwest of the island. The whole territory is covered with yellow sand, which mixes well with long rows of coconut palms. The current in the dry period of the year - from November to April - is almost absent, the water seems silent and still. The entire coastline is conditionally divided into three parts: north, south and center.</p><br>
    <p>At the same time, the northern part of the beach is more lively, and in the evenings it is even possible to call it noisy. The central part is under reconstruction, it’s difficult to call it construction, since some secluded corners of the beach are still good and accessible to tourists. And some areas are quite dusty and not quite clean from construction garbage. The southern part can be called deserted, although here it is possible to find a place for a quiet and secluded rest. However, a dirt road passes nearby, which can be washed away, thereby complicating the path for vacationers.</p><br>
    <p>It is not difficult to get to Long beach. There are buses on the island, taxis are available, car and motorbike hire. The beginning of the beach near the city and port may be polluted, and the coast in this part is quite narrow, but then the territory expands and becomes more comfortable.</p><br>
    <p>Many of the advantages of this unique beach include the fact, that no matter what time it is, there is always a place for everyone on Long beach. That is, even in the high season, the beach does not look crowded, either because of the huge length, or because of the careful and competent distributed rest areas - there are always plenty of local residents and tourists here.</p><br>
    
    <h3>When is it better to go?</h3>
    <p>Since Vietnam is a country stretching from north to south, the climate in its different parts is slightly different. In the north, high humidity and temperature are observed from May to October, but in the remaining months it is slightly drier and cooler. In the South, the rainy season is  longer, lasting from may to November, but even after it ends, the humidity does not subside. Therefore, it is better to go to popular resorts in the south of the country in winter or early spring.</p>

    <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>For vacationers at the beach are available sunbeds, massage treatments, the sale of juicy exotic fruits and light snacks, and the service takes place there where it is comfortable for the guest. Numerous cafes of the coastal zone hospitably welcome visitors at any time of the day, especially many those who want to take a cozy table in the late afternoon. This is because the view from the windows of the cafe is simply amazing, with no less outstanding sunset. The menu in local establishments is very diverse, here you can have a tasty lunch with the whole family and drink a glass of wine in a romantic setting in the evening.</p><br>
    <p>There are quite a lot of accommodation facilities in the area of the beach - these are budget hotels and elite bungalows in the first line of the beach. The choice depends on the budget and the desire of the guest, depending on what he or she wants to see in the hotel. For instance, Long Beach Resort Phu Quoc 4*, offers luxurious rooms in small buildings with amazing views, a spa and swimming pools.</p><br>
    <p>Regarding the territorial location, there are much more hotels in the northern part, all of them have different levels of service. The central part is more reserved for the construction of high-rise hotels and expensive resorts with modern shopping centers. In the south, housing is much more difficult to find.</p><br>
